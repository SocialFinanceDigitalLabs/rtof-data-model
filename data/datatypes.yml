# Simple types
string:
  description: >-
    A string of Unicode characters as defined by the JSON Schema `string` type.

integer:
  description: >-
    An integer as defined by the JSON Schema `integer` type.

date:
  description: >-
    Represents a single date. JSON Schema has no direct date representation,
    but can be considered a restriction on string to match the
    ISO-8601 format, e.g. 2021-07-20

# Complex types
year:
  extends: integer
  description: >-
    Represents a single (gregorian) year. There is no JSON Schema
    equivalent, but this should be considered to have the same meaning as
    `gYear` in XML Schema Part 2. Encoded as an integer.

monthyear:
  extends: string
  description: >-
    Represents a gregorian month. JSON Schema has no direct date representation,
    but can be considered a restriction on string to match the
    ISO-8601 format as also used by XML Schema Part 2 `gMonthYear`,
    e.g. 2021-07.

categorical:
  extends: string
  description: >-
    Restricted to a set of fixed values. Represented as a string, this type must
    have a `dimension` validator indicating the set of allowed values.

list:
  extends: string
  description: >-
    Can contain multiple values. Can either be represented as a native list
    in formats that support them, such as JSON or XML, or encoded as a
    CSV string. If accompanied by a `dimension` validator, then each item in
    the list must be in the allowed values.
